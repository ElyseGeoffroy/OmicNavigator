# Contributor Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders aim to make participation in the development of OmicNavigator a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We aim to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Package administrators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this standard of behavior and have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are inconsistent with this Code of Conduct.
